; boot.asm -- Kernel start location. Also defines multiboot header.

; Based on code from Bran's kernel development tutorial file start.asm
; Based on code from JamesM's kernel development tutorials.


MBOOT_PAGE_ALIGN equ 1<<0 ; Load kernel and modules on a page boundary
MBOOT_MEM_INFO equ 1<<1 ; Provide your kernel with memory info
MBOOT_HEADER_MAGIC equ 0x1BADB002 ; Multiboot Magic value
; NOTE: We do not use MBOOT_AOUT_KLUDGE. It means that GRUB does not
; pass us a symbol table.
MBOOT_HEADER_FLAGS equ MBOOT_PAGE_ALIGN | MBOOT_MEM_INFO
MBOOT_CHECKSUM equ -(MBOOT_HEADER_MAGIC + MBOOT_HEADER_FLAGS)

[GLOBAL mboot] ; Make 'mboot' accessible from C.
[EXTERN code] ; Start of the '.text' section.
[EXTERN bss] ; Start of the .bss section.
[EXTERN end] ; End of the last loadable section.
